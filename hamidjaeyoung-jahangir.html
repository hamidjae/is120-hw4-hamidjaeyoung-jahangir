<!-- The general layout of my webpage uses h1 and h3 to dictate different reading levels. I used the default table layout given in Slack to stylize the <table>
necessary in this homework, and used a generic name of a brand of grapes, grown in France as my product. The layout makes it easy to follow, and I used emphasis
and strong where ever it seemed logical to make the sales pitch more effective. I grouped sections with unique IDs so that it's easier at a glance to notice
where to look, and have a layout of <header> followed by <section>'s with unique IDs, and <footer> to denote the "About Us" area. I also used italics in my
instructions to make it pop and stand out -->

      <ol>
        <em>
          <li>
            Rinse the grapes under lukewarm water. Temperature extremes may harm
            the flavor profile.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gently remove a single grape from the stem, and check for visual
            discrepancies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Insert the grape, one at a time, into your mouth. Roll it around,
            before biting in.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fully savor the unique flavor profiles before inserting another
            grape into your mouth.
