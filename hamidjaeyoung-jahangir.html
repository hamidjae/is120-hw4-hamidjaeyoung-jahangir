<!-- The first CSS property I used that we didn't cover in class was display: block. This allows the image that I have to behave as a block-level element. Using this in combination with margin: auto allows me to center that image.
The second CSS property I used was block-size. This allows me to alter the size of the block element for the title, which was important for styling it so that it properly has gaps from top to middle and middle to top.
The third CSS property I used was filter. I used filter to transform the image to have 50% sepia, which makes the colors more lighter and makes it blend in better with the overall green aesthetic of the page. -->

        <em>
          <li>
            Rinse the grapes under lukewarm water. Temperature extremes may harm
            the flavor profile.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gently remove a single grape from the stem, and check for visual
            discrepancies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Insert the grape, one at a time, into your mouth. Roll it around,
            before biting in.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fully savor the unique flavor profiles before inserting another
            grape into your mouth.
